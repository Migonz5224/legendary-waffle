/* In Zybooks. 

Assignment: Assign secretID with firstName, a space, and lastName. Ex: If firstName is Barry and lastName is Allen, then output is:
Barry Allen

There are three strings. Two of which (line 13 and 14) firstName and lastName I am asking for input. The assignment is expecting an 
output of Barry Allen. Line 16 and 17 are attaching those names to the two strings. The assignment is asking to assing firstName and 
lastName to secretId which we did in line 22. Line 22 returns a new string that is appended. lastName string is added to the end of 
of the firstName string.

As a newbie, most of the program was written for me, but figuring out the proper way to add a space can be a bit tricky. 
Line 24 shows how to add a space. concat concatenates strings at the end of the string in this case firstName. We are adding at the end
of the firstName string a space. When secretID is being assigned firstName and lastName, the space is already attached to the firstName
string. The system will output Barry Allen.
