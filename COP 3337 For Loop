/* From Zybook Assignment: Write code that prints: userNum ... 2 1
Print a newline after each number. Ex: userNum = 3 outputs:

public class ForLoops {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    int userNum;
    int i;
    
    userNum = 3;
    
    //We know userNum equals 3. We want i to be 3. We assign userNum to i.
    //We are decrementing from userNum until we reach 1.
   
   for(i = userNum; i >= 1; --i) {
      System.out.println(i);
      }
    }
 }
