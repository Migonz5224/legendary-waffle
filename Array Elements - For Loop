/* Assignment: Write a for loop to print all elements in courseGrades, following each element with a space (including the last). 
Print forwards, then backwards. End each loop with a newline. Ex: If courseGrades = {7, 9, 11, 10}, print:
7 9 11 10 
10 11 9 7 
Hint: Use two for loops. Second loop starts with i = courseGrades.length - 1. */
